    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    cd your-repository-name
    ```

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Customize

You can easily customize this portfolio to make it your own.

1.  **Update Personal Information:**
    * Open `index.html`.
    * Change the name, title, and bio in the hero section (`<div class="content">`).
    * Update the "About Me" section (`<section class="about-section">`) with your details.

2.  **Change the Profile Picture:**
    * Place your photo (e.g., `my-photo.jpg`) inside the project folder (or an `images` subfolder).
    * Open `style.css`.
    * Find the `.circle:nth-child(2)` rule.
    * Change the `background-image` URL to point to your new picture:
        ```css
        .circle:nth-child(2) {
            /* ... other styles */
            background-image: url(path/to/your/my-photo.jpg); 
        }
        ```

3.  **Update Skills:**
    * In `index.html`, navigate to the "My Programming Skills" section (`<section id="Skills">`).
    * For each skill, you can change the name (e.g., `<p>C</p>`) and adjust your proficiency by changing the `width` percentage in the inline style of the `.bar` div:
        ```html
        <div class="skill">
          <p>JavaScript</p>
          <div class="skill-bar">
            <div class="bar" style="width: 90%;"></div> 
          </div>
        </div>
        ```

4.  **Add/Update Projects:**
    * In `index.html`, find the "My Project" section (`<section id="project">`).
    * Modify the content inside each `<div class="project-card">` for your projects.
    * Update the `<h3>` for the title, the `<p>` tags for the description, and the `href` in the `<a>` tag to link to your project's code or live demo.

5.  **Update Social Media Links:**
    * In `index.html`, find the `<div class="icon">` section.
    * Change the `href` attribute in each `<a>` tag to your social media profile URLs. You can add or remove icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
        ```html
        <a href="[https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile)" target="_blank">
          <i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin-in"></i>
        </a>
        ```
